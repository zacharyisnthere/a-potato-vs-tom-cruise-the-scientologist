TO DO:
DONE! 0 - add a pause menu in game
DONE-? 1 - add settings
    *X Volume (master, music, sfx)
    * full screen mode, resizable screen mode
    * change colors, images, sounds
    * secret codes? 
    * bonus - change controls? map to gamepad?
2 - How to play instructions
    * put in settings? own screen? Just put in text at the bottom of the screen? Latter seems nice?
3 - Fix Font to make nicer
3 - refactor? make pretty code, COMPILE AND STUFF 
4 - upload to itch.io 

add ideas for features below?

instead of the scuffed menu_selected system I have now, the buttons and sliders should have a function that the input system can access and call upon selecting. Only write the code once.

========

* add a menu, some ui
* instructions, some basic text to show controls
* settings menu
    * Master Volume (mute toggle button)
    * Music Volume
    * SFX Volume
    * Controls (figure out how to change controls in an intuitive way for the end user)

NOTE: Figure out how to map gamepad as input. 



UI State System:
boolean? X I want it to be more modular than that, have it be an int value where 0 is the the menu or whatever

state_scene:
0 - menu 
1 - settings
2 - game


structure:

imports







====
venv needs to be activated. If I run a .py file normally, it runs on the global python rather than the python inside the venviornment. 


(step 1: nav to file path)
cd /home/zachary/Documents/Repos/SpaceShooterGame

activate venv:
source venv/bin/activate

run .py inside venv:
python3 [filename].py
