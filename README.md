A Potato vs Tom Cruise the Scientologist
A game where you play as a Potato vs Tom Cruise the Scientologist

Made using pygame-ce by Zachary Petersen
I can be reached at [zachbrian.petersen@gmail.com] if you want to or whatever.



===how to play===
In the top folder, there should be an executable file titled "main".
Run that, and the game should start.
NOTE: Currently this version only runs on linux machines. Sorry if you don't have one of those.


Inside the game, the controls should be listed at the bottom of the screen. You can also see them here:
keyboard controls ==> wasd to move, arrow keys to fire.
gamepad controls ==> left joystick to move, right joystick to aim, right trigger to fire.

Note you need to use the movement controls and the "select" button ("A" on xbox controller, "enter" key on keyboard) to navigate the menus.

I made this to get some practice with python and try out some structures. By the time I started compiling, I had already stopped caring about clean and pretty code so please don't look too closely at anything under the hood. It feels like someone stepping into my dirty car, and I feel judged. 
I did get it working with gamepad though, which I think is cool.

tip: type "batman" to unlock the secret mode, inspired by my girlfriend who is batman.
